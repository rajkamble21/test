# CSS/HTML Home page
---
# Introduction
You are tasked to create engaging home page for a client. Some features were already implemented but there is a request that you finish it up and meet the deadline.


# Problem Statement
Please complete missing CSS property definitions so the page displays the appropriate splash loader screen before it displays the home page.
 
You should implement:
* fill navbar with `black` color, make the text inside white and without decoration specific to anchor `<a>` tags
* add padding of 15px to nav bar anchor items and display them as a block of elements
* use **flexbox** to display the nav html code as a navigation bar. The end result is displayed on the image mentioned below.
* add `home-page.png` as a background image to div with class `wrapper`
* add `Home Page` text to span with class `heading` and set font size to 60px.
 
For the splash screen:
* position each circle item absolutely, 50 percent from top and left corners
* animate each circle item for 2 seconds, infinitely and set `rotate` keyframe rule for it
* first circle item should have `width` and `height` of `120px` and each following circle item after it should have 20px lower size than the one before it
 
For browser compatibility:
* make sure includes method used in `index.html` is browser compatible
* your implementation should be contained in `main.js` file

# Hints
* it should throw TypeError if RegEx is used as a first argument
* it should take a string and an optional position argument
